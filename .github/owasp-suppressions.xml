            CVE-2016-1000027: Spring Framework YAML deserialization vulnerability
            Added: 2025-12-04 by Security Team
            Justification: We do not use SnakeYAML for untrusted input deserialization.
            Our YAML parsing is only for configuration files loaded at startup.

    <!-- Log4j false positives (we use Logback) -->
    <suppress>
        <notes>
            Suppress all Log4j 1.x CVEs as we use Logback for logging.
            Added: 2025-12-04 by Security Team
            Justification: Log4j 1.x is a transitive dependency from legacy libraries
            but is not used for logging in BUTTERFLY services.
